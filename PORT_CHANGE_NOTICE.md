# üö® IMPORTANT: Port Change Notice

## Your Trading Journal is Now Running on Port 3001

### ‚úÖ **Working URL**: `http://localhost:3001/dashboard`
### ‚ùå **Old URL**: `http://localhost:3000/dashboard` (still showing loading)

## What Happened
During the infinite loop fixes, we had to restart the development server. The new server automatically chose port 3001 because port 3000 was still occupied by the old server.

## Next Steps
1. **Visit the new URL**: `http://localhost:3001/dashboard`
2. **You should see**: "Welcome back, mike" with your fixed dashboard
3. **All features should work**: No more infinite loops

## To Use Port 3000 Again (Optional)
If you want to use port 3000:
1. Stop the old server: `pkill -f "next dev"`
2. Start fresh: `npm run dev`
3. It will use port 3000 again

## Status
- ‚úÖ **Infinite loops**: FIXED
- ‚úÖ **Calendar components**: FIXED
- ‚úÖ **Authentication**: Working with demo mode
- ‚úÖ **Dashboard**: Loading properly on port 3001
- ‚úÖ **All features**: Ready for testing

Your trading journal is fully functional and ready for use!
