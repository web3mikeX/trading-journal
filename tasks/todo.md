# Beautify DetaWise Sign-In Page

## Problem Analysis
The current sign-in page needs to be updated with proper DetaWise branding and made more beautiful. Currently it says "Sign in to your trading journal" and has generic styling.

## Plan
Enhance the sign-in page with:

Keep all existing functionality while making it visually stunning.
